    <h1> Stretch, Strength and SMART Goal </h1>
    <h2> Stretch </h2>
      <div class="men">
    <p>  My stretch is writing essays. I find essays challenging to write and hard to make my thoughts flow. I feel that my stretch is still a stretch, I still don't feel confident after writing my essays and it isn't easier to write them as well. I am still getting consistent 85-88 grades on my essays. I will improve on this by writing a more descriptive thinking map so I can get all my ideas down and organize them so my essay will flow and have detailed analysis. </p>
      </div>
    <h2> Strength </h2>
         <div class="men">
    <p> My strength is not procrastinating. My new Strength of not procrastinating has helped me on many projects such as annotations. By spacing out my annotations and doing some every day, I get more free time and am able to do activities I love. My strength will also help me in my future career because I can space out my assignments and won't have to do them at the last minute.  </p>
      </div>
    <h2> SMART Goal </h2>
       <div class="men">
    <p> My SMART goal was to improve and feel more confident after writing my essays. I have tried to work to my goal by writing a more descriptive thinking map. By having a detailed thinking map I can organize my thoughts so my essay will flow and have analysis as well. I will achieve my goal by spending more time on my essays and I will add more analysis. I will also annotate documents and books so I can get my ideas down and use that for my essay. </p>
