  <h1> Mid-Year Reflection</h1>

       <h2> My Friend Group</h2>
      <li><p class="lolxd">
    I have a big social group with many friends. Everyone is accepted in our frieng group because we always welcome anyone who want's to play with us. I have improved the social atmosphere by introducing new conversations with my friends.

      <h2> My Contributions to the Community</h2>
      
      <li><p class="lolxd">
          I have contributed to my community by helping out my peers. This year I gave a presentation on time managment to help my peers learn how to space out their homework load by organizing themselves. I have grown as a leader by not giving up on my ideas when my peers tell me otherwise. I have also grown as a leader by being vice president of our school. I can now improve the student culture of our school by taking students' thoughts into consideration and implementing them into school life.

      <h2> Completing my Work on Time</h2>
      
     <li> <p class="lolxd">
          I am consistent on completing my work on time. My activities outside of school are hindering me by not giving me as much time to do homework, because of this I am able to space out my homework load which has been helping me.
